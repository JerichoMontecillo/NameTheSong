# NameTheSong

Can you guess the song that contains the line?

To run this project, extract the zip folder and then just open the front_page.html page and begin playing from there by selecting an album.
Each quiz contains 5 questions containing songs only from the chosen album.
After the quiz, you are met with the option to replay the album or to go back to the starting page to choose a new album.

My project only contains albums and songs from Taylor Swift.
Each song from albums only have one lyric mapped to it as I didn't want to spend too much time inputing multiple lines per song as she has over 200 songs within her albums.
If I wanted to, I could easily put more lines for each song too make it less likely to see the same question across multiple quizzes.
Because each song has only one line mapped to it, once a question for a song is chosen, the song will no longer appear in the possible answers for the rest of the questions in the given 5 question quiz.

The answer and options for each question are shown in the console when a question pops up.
Along with the visual green or red box that tells the player thay they got it correct or wrong, the console also outputs whether the answer is correct or wrong.
